allows for playlists to have "sources". This means that a playlist will update upon additions to any of its sources, but if other songs are added to a source and then deleted from the destination they will not be copied.

ex: 1 : {a,b} , 2 : {d, e} 3 : dest
3 will initially contain: {a,b,d,e}
then user deletes song a from 3
3:{b,d,e}
user adds c to 1:
1: {a,b,c} 3 : {b,c,d,e}
user deletes d from 2
2: {e} (no change to 3)

frontend to backend is plain HTTP requests with JSON data (do this)

Backend endpoints: auth, get and show all playlists, show and create drainlists

daily run the sync. 


current hardcoded: 
    spotify: one drainlist filename
    playlist: source_name, username
